# Hypothesis_Testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is enough evidence to support or reject a claim about a population based on sample data. It involves comparing a sample statistic to a hypothesized population parameter.
In hypothesis testing, we use statistical methods to analyze sample data and make inferences about a population.
We start with a null hypothesis, which is the assumption that there is no significant difference or relationship between two or more variables. 
We then collect and analyze data to determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis. 
To do this, we use test statistics, p-values, confidence intervals, and other tools of statistical inference. 
Ultimately, hypothesis testing helps us make more informed decisions and draw conclusions based on evidence rather than intuition or speculation.
